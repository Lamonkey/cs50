                                    <p> At least eight varieties of trees have been identified in the screens,
                                        reflecting a
                                        growing interest at that time among educated Japanese in natural history
                                        classification.
                                        Yet even with careful attention to botanical accuracy, the painter offers no
                                        suggestion
                                        of spatial relationship between the trees. Indeed, the real subject of the
                                        painting is
                                        jarring contrast: realism in form but not space, dramatic asymmetry, and bold
                                        color
                                        contrast.

                                        The circular vermilion seals, reading "I'nen" and seen on the extreme left and right
                                        panels of this screen set, were used by the Kyoto painter Tawaraya Sōtatsu (active
                                        circa
                                        1600–1640) and by several generations of his followers. Sōtatsu's follower, Sōsetsu
                                        (active 1630–1650) is a strong candidate as the user of these "I'nen" seals. He
                                        migrated
                                        from Kyoto to serve Lord Maeda, head of the family who ruled Kaga Province, north of
                                        Kyoto; these screens were likely commissioned for the Maeda family</p>
