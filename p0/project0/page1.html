                                    <p> I am not trying to make facsimiles
                                        of photographs. Neither am I interested in
                                        the icon of the head as a total image.
                                        I don’t want the viewer to see the whole
                                        head at once and assume that that’s the most
                                        important aspect of my painting. I am not making
                                        Pop personality posters like the ones they sell
                                        in the Village. That’s why I choose to do portraits
                                        of my friends–individuals that most people will not
                                        recognize. I don’t want the viewer to recognize the
                                        head of Castro and think he has understood my work.–Chuck Close,
                                        1970</p>

                                        Chuck Close’s approach to the canvas was inspired by the non-hierarchical, all-over
                                        surface of
                                        American painting epitomized for him by the work of Abstract Expressionists such as
                                        Jackson
                                        Pollock. After taking a picture of his subject, Close makes photographic prints that
                                        he uses to
                                        transfer the images to canvas. Utilizing a technique devised by Renaissance masters
                                        and adapted
                                        by contemporary billboard painters, Close overlays a working print with a numbered
                                        and lettered
                                        grid, and then reproduces the image block by block.

                                <li>

                                    <p>In this format the image becomes a mosaic of black, gray, and white visual
                                        information that the
                                        artist replicates by spraying a mixture of black acrylic paint and water onto the
                                    canvas with an
                                    airbrush. Specific features like the illusion of light reflecting off the hairs of
                                    his beard
                                    were achieved by scratching paint from the surface of the canvas with a razor blade.

                                    Self-Portrait was the first of Close’s no-signature series of monumental
                                    head-and-shoulder
                                    portraits.</p>
