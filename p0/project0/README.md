There are five webpages in total,A home page and four other pages. Each pages introduce one of the pieces indivadually.

* requirement 1: Five webpages totoaly. Interacting with img in webpage go to the accroded page or click homepage to return.

* used table in index.html and unordered list in page1,2,3,4

* Used 1.class, 2.Id, 3.element, 4.element.class, 5.element > element selector.

* Used media query in html file page1,2,3,4. The effect is to rearrange displaied img when screen is too small.

* Used bootstrap 4 model on index.html. The effect is to rearrange displaied image according to large screen, medium screen and small screen.

* The stylesheet for index.html is genreated using sass.
