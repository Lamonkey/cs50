                            <p>Another year of old hard dying habits is about to pass, we rip off the last sheet of the
                                calendar and face it - it has arrived: the resolution! And ever anticipated example of
                                “same thing, but different”, probably the most naive goal of the year, but still a plan
                                never the less. For the next year I’ve decided to stay realistic, really realistic,
                                “starting this year I have until 2018 to stop smoking” kind of realistic… Is it too much
                                realistic? Chuck Close is one of the Photorealists who is helping my argument. Evolving
                                from pop-art, that also made a great use out of photography , photorealism embraces the
                                raw capture of a photo, and expresses it as realistically as possible in painting.
                                Photography and painting might seam like two antagonistic entities, but since the very
                                invention of the first it has influenced the way artists worked and faced their canvas.
                                Some argue that it was photography that freed the Impressionists from the strict
                                boundaries of representation to paint the colours and forms we came to love. So does
                                that mean that if I’m too realistic with my resolutions, I will not be as inventive as
                                the impressionists were, and might end up my next year in a less colourful way; or
                                should I be seeing thing in the way they truly are, real? You tell me, if you were to
                                have you portrait painted next year, would you like it to be hyperrealistic, or to
                                express invented features? Artur Deus Dionisio wishes you a great New Year - and the
                                rest of DailyArt team too, but wait for our official wishes until tomorrow :]
